In order to run processing-java, to my knowledge, you need to add it to your PATH.
This can be done by downloading another processing folder, then:
## Windows
- Going to Environment Variables
- Editing PATH and adding it as a variable
## Ubuntu
- Use `nano ~/.bashrc`
- At the very end of the file, add a little command that looks like
- `export PATH="<PATH TO PROCESSING FOLDER>:$PATH"`
Note: The processing-java file must live with processing.exe (supposedly)
