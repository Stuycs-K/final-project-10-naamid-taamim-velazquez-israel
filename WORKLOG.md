### 5/22/24

I have finished clearing out my entire home directory. Firefox apparently took nearly a full gigabyte in total and that was fun to clear
I have made a tryhackme room and invited Taamim into it. Currently doesn't have much, but we're ready to work on it, and add the answers into the hints so it's not too hard
We also have created a team name, previously I made it Tameal, but now we have instead gone for 'Isam'... Enjoy!
Found some gifs on the internet to add to the project, trying to figure out how to install processing java
added Processing-java

### 5/22/24 HW

updated Homework.md
found a place to install processing-java but it seems like that'll take .5 GB, which only I can stomach before it makes our GB limit go above 1GB

### 5/23/24 

Delted Homework.md
Struggled with Animation, and trying to figure out how to import a class even though it worked in my previous project
I clapped loudly because it seemed like Mr K was trying to gather everyone's attentions and then people were still talking over him "Childreen should be seen not heard" was the phrase I heard him utter. So then my thought process was to gather everyone's attention to Mr K because he was prolly trying to tell us something and instead it seemed like I was being an idiot... Which I was lmao
I've also attempted to figure out how to import libraries instead of doing an Animation class... This also failed on us. I'm not sure exactly how to continue honestly

Doing some worksheet filling

### May 22, 2024 (HW)

Tried to figure out how to use processing-java in order to run processing from terminal?, which would be useful since then we can just tun it from a makefile (not much luck).
