### 5/22/24

I have finished clearing out my entire home directory. Firefox apparently took nearly a full gigabyte in total and that was fun to clear
I have made a tryhackme room and invited Taamim into it. Currently doesn't have much, but we're ready to work on it, and add the answers into the hints so it's not too hard
We also have created a team name, previously I made it Tameal, but now we have instead gone for 'Isam'... Enjoy!
Found some gifs on the internet to add to the project, trying to figure out how to install processing java
added Processing-java

### 5/22/24 HW

updated Homework.md
found a place to install processing-java but it seems like that'll take .5 GB, which only I can stomach before it makes our GB limit go above 1GB

### 5/23/24 

Delted Homework.md
Struggled with Animation, and trying to figure out how to import a class even though it worked in my previous project
I clapped loudly because it seemed like Mr K was trying to gather everyone's attentions and then people were still talking over him "Childreen should be seen not heard" was the phrase I heard him utter. So then my thought process was to gather everyone's attention to Mr K because he was prolly trying to tell us something and instead it seemed like I was being an idiot... Which I was lmao
I've also attempted to figure out how to import libraries instead of doing an Animation class... This also failed on us. I'm not sure exactly how to continue honestly
I've figured out how to make it work :D. I had forgotten a bit of java cause it was processing, I have to do 'new Animation' in order to get it to work

### 5/23/24 HW

We discussed creating different functions in order to make the workload more seamless and clean. 
I have also discovered that the only way to work with gifs in processing is with our old graphics project :/
This will be fun to consider the implications of. I'll try and find out if you can convert a gif into a the series of kmages that it is.
otherwise there's almost no real way to do our project D;

### 5/24/24

I have discovered a way to turn online gifs into images in order to work properly with our processing program
I have made a makefile
I have made that makefile not have any error when you try to make clean, because it was bothering me D;

### May 22, 2024

Doing some worksheet filling

### May 22, 2024 (HW)

Tried to figure out how to use processing-java in order to run processing from terminal?, which would be useful since then we can just tun it from a makefile (not much luck).

### May 23, 2024

Tried to work on getting processing-java and failed, the PATH is not PATH-ing even thought I added it to like .bashrc or something and failed, it works on windows though so maybe that means something / worth considering.

### May 23, 2024 (HW)

Trued to get processing-java to work again, but Ubuntu seems to be really averse to working the way I think it would. Supposedly just adding it to the PATH should work (did for windows at least) but Ubuntu really doesn't care about it (maybe my cmd was wrong or something? It is definitely added to thr PATH though).
