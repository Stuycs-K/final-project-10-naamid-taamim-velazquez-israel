# Wow we have things to do 
## Phase 1: GIF (pronounced as "GIF")
- Being able to turn GIFs into PImage arrays and back
- Being able to use our image processing lab to encode/decode images from these images
- Being able to use all color channels instead of just red
- Being able to encode a larger image into multiple images beacuse frames and such associated with GIFs
- Being able to encode/decode GIFs from GIFs
## Phase 2: Videos and FFmpegs
- Being able to turn an FFmpeg into a GIF / frames (whichever is more convenient)
- Being able to turn a GIF / frames into an FFmpeg
- Making sure that the video is lossless (FFmpeg should be, but just in case)
## Phase 3: We have too much time, so audio as well
- Getting the audio from FFmpeg using FLAC
- Being able to encode / decode audio
- Being able to combine the encoded audio back into FLAC and onto an FFmpeg
## Phase 4: We REALLY have too much time
- Making an actually nice-ly edited video
- Making a THM room
- Etc
