## Phase 1: GIF (pronounced as "GIF")
- Being able to turn GIFs into PImage arrays and back
- Being able to use our image processing lab to encode/decode images from these images
- Being able to use all color channels instead of just red
- Being able to encode a larger image into multiple images beacuse frames and such associated with GIFs
- Being able to encode/decode GIFs from GIFs
## Phase 2: I didn't plan this part out
